    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This definitely is not authentic, and may not even be considered pasta aglio e olie at all, but it's my take on a dish in its vein. One night, I had leftover fettuccine noodles, some raw spinach, garlic that was getting old, and frozen meatballs. I threw them together with a generous helping of EVOO and parmesan cheese, and this was the result. The family liked it so much I've made it countless times since, and finally wrote it down in a recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb pasta (I usually use fettuccine)
            <li>8-12 large garlic cloves, sliced thin (I’ve also minced it)</li>
            <li>½ cup EVOO</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
            <li>Couple of grinds of salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Dried parsley flakes</li>
            <li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>24 Kirkland Italian meatballs, heated in microwave</li>
            <li>1 tub of baby spinach from Costco</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta until it is slightly firmer than you normally like.
        <li>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet large enough to also hold the pasta.  Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low when garlic begins to brown slightly.  Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, at least another 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and dried parsley flakes.  Stir.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and meatballs.  Toss in the oil mixture and continue to stir/toss occasionally until warm.</li>
        <li>Add baby spinach and mix until wilted.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle in parmesan cheese and toss to coat.
        <li>Serve.</li>
    </ol>
